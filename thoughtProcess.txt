Beginning with two main concepts

incompressible fluids = fluids that must remain constant density throughout (water for example)
compressible fluids = density can change, ex. air
Navier-Stokes equations 

Incompressible: 
A. Vector Field(x, y z?):
    - in a grid of pixles, there is a velocity vector in each grid that points to a direction
    - the velocity field/ vector field either two or three dimensional 


    | ->Â | -> 

B. Dye (amount ): 
    - defuse all around the fluid
    - density of the dye can be a vector field 


1. a grid of (x, y, density), two of the same time where the other one is the "previous" array
2. linear solve with gauss- seidel
